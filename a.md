Uh, so hopefully you've done those and what I'll do is I will.
Umm, I'll just, I'll get them to you over the next couple of days hopefully this afternoon, but over the next day or two I will post the feedback for your group into your team chat and then I will then you are you are asked to include that as an appendix to your final report with a responses to the suggestions to to let us know what you've done in response to the feedback. So the reason we're doing this is because you know whether you.

That you're in academia or in the workforce or whatever you're doing. You know, when you do work, you get feedback on it and you change what you're doing in response to the feedback. This is the feedback cycle. It's it's part of life. And so we might as well get some practice with it early on the other. But the other side of it, by reviewing other people's work, it also gives you some insight into what you could do differently as well. So it helps you looking at other people's work helps you see what to do with your own. And also it gives you an opportunity to see what other people are up to. So.
For most of the groups, are you got to look at two different themes to your own in the peer review and you'll get to watch talks. If you look at the the schedule for talks, you'll be watching talks from a different group again. So as well as spending most of your term focusing on a particular project, you're also getting a chance to see what other people are up to as well.
So it's an added benefit of these of this process.
Umm. Speaking of the group presentations, they are are coming up next week and the way we're asking you to do that is to upload a 12 minute prerecorded presentation to the common channel for your project theme.
And then we will work through them at scheduled times, so.
OK, I'll share screen on that so you can see, but it's just in the chat just above above what we're talking about.
But just above, uh, just in the common uh channel. So here it is.
Yeah, so cannabis will be working through those talks on Wednesday, starting at next Wednesday, starting at 10:30 and cybersecurity also next Wednesday at 10:30. There will be in their respective.
A common project channels and students from the proteins project theme are asked to mark these cannabis ones, so projects, protein projects. People should also turn up to the cannabis talks next Wednesday and NRL people are being asked to mark the cyber security talks so you guys will need to turn up on Wednesday at this time as well as these guys. So both of these groups turn up here and both of these groups turn up here.
One group is answering questions and they're talks. The other is giving the Marks and vice versa. On the Thursday starting at 4, the cyber people are marking the NRL projects and they cannabis people marking the proteins.
Does that all make sense?
So next week we've got a good three hours of talks to either answer questions from if you're a presenter, or to to mark if you're not.
And so the marks here, here's a suggested scale for the marks. You'll supervisors will also be marking and then I'll do some magic to turn all of these information into a into a score. But when marking on structure delivery, visual AIDS and knowledge displayed.
Any questions?
OK, so that is the uh presentations and then the week after that we got the uh project reports due on Moodle. So they are due also Wednesday 10:00 o'clock but that's week 11. So we've still got two weeks for that and each team member must complete their questionnaire associated with the team submission.
Which is just describing how how much of the work was done in the different sections of the project was done by different people, and there's a comment section as well if you want to elaborate. So please make sure you all do that as well by Wednesday. Or we could even.
Any questions?
No, Dylan, us. Will we be given a template?
Uh, you'll be given something to mark with for the presentations. So yeah. So I'll give you. There's gonna be a form on Moodle, just a questionnaire where you just write them out of 10. Just give him a certain number of stars out of 10. So that's all.
Uh, yeah, that's all we'll be given in terms of the marking. And so that's and again, that was on structure to be revitalized and and knowledge. And so you just have a single score considering those factors.
Uh, a template? I guess stealing maybe. You mean a template for the final report? And no, I'm afraid I do not have a template for you for the final report.
But you do have feedback on your draft.
Yeah, OK, so marking the talks you give a Group A score.
So so when you are marking the talks, each individual gives each Group A score.
So if there's 30 people working in under the proteins theme, then there should be 30 marks for the six cannabis talks next week.
Anything else?
